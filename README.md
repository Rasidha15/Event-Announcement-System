# Event Announcement System

The **Event Announcement System** is a cloud-based web application designed to simplify the process of announcing and managing events online. It uses various AWS services to ensure scalability, reliability, and automation.

## Features
- Hosts a static website using **Amazon S3**.
- Processes event announcements through **API Gateway** and **AWS Lambda**.
- Stores event data securely in **Amazon DynamoDB**.
- Sends notifications to subscribers via **Amazon SNS**.
- Uses **IAM** for secure access and permissions management.

## Technologies Used
- **Amazon S3** ‚Äì For hosting the frontend static website.  
- **Amazon API Gateway** ‚Äì Connects the frontend with the backend Lambda function.  
- **AWS Lambda** ‚Äì Executes backend logic without managing servers.  
- **Amazon DynamoDB** ‚Äì NoSQL database for storing event and subscriber data.  
- **Amazon SNS** ‚Äì Sends real-time notifications to users.  
- **AWS IAM** ‚Äì Manages roles and access permissions.

## How It Works
1. Users submit event details through the web interface.  
2. API Gateway triggers a Lambda function.  
3. Lambda stores event details in DynamoDB.  
4. SNS sends notifications to subscribers about new events.  
5. The static site hosted on S3 displays all event updates.

## Project Type
